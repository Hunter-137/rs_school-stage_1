# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

## Reflections

- In the first module, I understood what Typescript is for in general. Typescript is needed in order to avoid potential errors at the code development stage. How? - strict typing, relative to Javascript.
- In the second module, I learned exactly how variables can be typed. This is done by adding types to, for example, variables, separated by colons.
- In the third module I learned about interfaces. As far as I understand, they are needed to complete the variables. That is, for example, when creating a function, we create certain variables for this specific function. Interfaces help define the types of variables in a given function and provide a clearer view of the code.

I will definitely take the rest of the courses during this week. The reason for lack of preparation is preparation for defending a thesis. At a minimum, my defense received a "Good" rating. üôÉ
