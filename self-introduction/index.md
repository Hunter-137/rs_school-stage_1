### Transcript of presentation:

Hello! My name is Amal, I am from Uzbekistan, Tashkent city. I am 22 years old at the time of recording the video, and today I will tell you a little about myself :)

At the moment I am a beginner front-end developer, I have been studying programming since fifth of January, 2023. I mostly work on my own and during this time I managed to learn HTML and CSS quite well, as well as acquire basic knowledge of JavaScript.

Through the recommendations of friends, I learned about the course The Rolling Scopes school and I am extremely grateful to everyone, since I learned my real practical problems at stage 0. At first it was completely unusual to apply the accumulated theoretical knowledge in practice, I even remember having to retake the JavaScript course again on the code-basic website.

However, over time I got better and better, and that’s how I managed to finish stage 0 with a certificate! :) Without stopping, I continued development and registered at stage 1.

I plan to thoroughly learn React in the near future. By the way, I have already started taking lessons!

So, how did I come to programming?

In general, I am an accountant by profession. I am practically a graduate of the Siberian University of Consumer Cooperation — my diploma will be defended on February 21st, I am in distance learning. In addition to my basic studies, I took courses in accounting, got a job: first in a credit company as an assistant accountant, then in another company as an accountant — I calculated wages, paid taxes, compiled reports for several companies at once...

And after accounting, I ended up in the finance department, in another company. I worked there unofficially. The main task was filling out reports in Excel. I worked for them for a year and during that time I learned Excel quite well to the point of becoming a confident user. True, I didn’t get to macros, but I was able to learn and even use another functions to process large amounts of data, create tables to keep track of profits and losses, accounting of debtors and creditors, and even use it all to making money in small projects.

Having been in such an atmosphere, I still realized that I am more of a creative person :) Then I was advised to go into programming, front-end development. I tried it and I liked it! After all, here you can create something colorful :) But in the field of accountants and financiers, unfortunately, there are only dry, gray numbers.

Well, if I tell you a little more about myself, I really like to eat delicious food, I can cook at the “I won’t die of hunger” level, and in the warm season I shoot with a classic bow - I even competed in competitions :)
I also tried myself in historical fencing — HEMA. It's great!

Sometimes I play chess — the rating on chess com in rapid is 950. I also welcome card games like "Stormbound", and sometimes I hang out in the game "War Thunder" in simulator battles on planes or in realistic battles on tanks :)

Yes, I like hard video-games — they're fun! If you don’t believe me, you can go through all the parts of Dark Souls, you should like it ;)

If you want to play something with me or just chat, write, I’ll be glad to see everyone)

I think I should end here :)
Thank you all so much for watching, good luck! ^-^❤️

P.s. I apologize for my English, my level is elementary and therefore I had to use a translator to read my prepared text for self-presentation. But I will definitely improve my English level, because I downloaded Duolingo! :D
